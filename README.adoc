Running the Sample app
----------------------


There are two ways to run the entire application:

* On Local Machine
* Using Docker

On Local Machine
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Running it all local is simple, do the following in sequence, in four different terminal windows:

.Start up RabbitMQ Server
[source,java]
----
rabbitmq-server
----

.Start up Sample Service - Instance 1
[source,java]
----
cd sample-hystrix-app
mvn spring-boot:run
----

.Start up Sample Service - Instance 2
[source,java]
----
cd sample-hystrix-app
mvn spring-boot:run -Dserver.port=8081
----


.Start up Turbine AMQP
[source,java]
----
cd sample-turbine-amqp
mvn spring-boot:run
----

.Start up Monitoring Application
[source,java]
----
cd sample-hystrix-dashboard
mvn spring-boot:run
----


If all the applications have come up cleanly the sample hystrix dashboard UI is available at http://localhost:9080/hystrix and add in http://localhost:8989 as the location of the stream

On Docker
~~~~~~~~~

Running using Docker is even simpler, assuming that docker-compose and docker are installed on your box, just run the following:

.Build the docker images for the microservices
[source,java]
----
mvn clean package docker:build
----

.Start up Docker containers
[source,java]
----
docker-compose up
----

If all the applications have come up cleanly, the following endpoints are available at http://dockerip:9080/hystrix/monitor?stream=http%3A%2F%2Fsampleturbineamqp%3A8080
